# Datasets for the flood prediction

1.	Data Collection and Preparation: 				       
The datasets required for the process of flood prediction will consist of both vector and raster data. The datasets are temperature, rainfall, historical flood data, distance from rivers, elevation, Topographic Position Index (TPI), slope, future precipitation, and future temperature. A total of 7 major causal factors will be used for flood prediction.
